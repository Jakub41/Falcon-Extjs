# Falcon ExtJS Project

## Intro

This project was built with **Sencha ExtJS Framework**. The purpose of it was to demonstrate how I resolved a particular task from **Falcon** as a part of an interview process. 

As a preface, I did not have any previous experience in the technology until this assignment was given to me. I had to learn from scratch with the documentation provided by the organisation and my online research.

## Environment

As requested I used **Ext JS 6.5** and installed **Sencha Cmd**. The request was motivated as the new version has bugs.

**Sencha ExtJS** is a premium framework, and for this reason, I used an evaluation copy for 30dd

## Resources & Documentation

As described above, I had to learn the framework from scratch. I used for my research the documentation provided by the company plus **YouTube**, **Google** and **StackOverFlow**. 

List of resources from **Falcon**:

- [Sencha Cmd](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/cmd-download/)
- [Sencha Cmd Smart Guide](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0.2/guides/getting_started/getting_started.html)
- [MVVM vs. MVC](https://www.sencha.com/blog/ext-js-5-mvc-mvvm-and-more/)
- [Sencha Guides](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0.2/guides/core_concepts/classes.html), [Guide2](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0.2/guides/application_architecture/application_architecture.html)
- [Grids and renderer method](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0.2/classic/Ext.grid.Panel.html)
- [Examples & Kitchensink Classic](http://examples.sencha.com/extjs/6.2.0/examples/), [examples](http://examples.sencha.com/extjs/6.2.0/examples/kitchensink/) 

## The Task

Along side the task was provided the next material:

- The document contains the task [specification](https://github.com/Jakub41/Falcon-Extjs/tree/master/Doc/Nordantech_Ext JS_Challenge.pdf) 
- 3 files CSV under the folder [`CSV/FromFalcon`](https://github.com/Jakub41/Falcon-Extjs/tree/master/CSV/FromFalcon)

I resolved the task as required and I add an extra feature called **uploads**.

The **uploads** feature works in this way, a user can upload a CSV file which is converted into a table through the CSV converter tool, implemented in this project. For test the **uploads** I made a folder under [`CSV/Samples`](https://github.com/Jakub41/Falcon-Extjs/tree/master/CSV/Samples) which contains some CSV files for test the tool.
